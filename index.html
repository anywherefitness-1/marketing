          <td><p>Circuit training consists of a consecutive series of timed exercises performed one after the other with varying amounts of rest between each exercise. An example of a simple circuit training workout might consist of push-ups, sit-ups, squats, chin-ups and lunges</p>
            <p>Circuit training is a combination of six or more exercises performed with short rest periods between them for either a set number of repetitions or a prescribed amount of time.

          <td><p>The ultimate aim of Yoga is to experience the Truth, by realizing the true nature of our 'Self' and the Universe. Then one can become free from the chain of cause and effect (Karma) which brings us to earthly life again and again.</p>
            <p>Yoga manifests itself as four major paths, namely Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Rāja Yoga and Jñāna Yoga. These four paths are like the branches of a tree or tributaries of a river.</p></td>
          <td>Pilates is a form of exercise emphasizing the balanced development of the body through core strength, flexibility, and awareness to support efficient, graceful movement. It was developed by Joseph Pilates and is also known as the Pilates Method.
